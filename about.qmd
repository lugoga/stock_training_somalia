## Program Overview

The **Somali Fish Stock Training Program** is a comprehensive capacity-building initiative to establish evidence-based fisheries management across Somalia's 6 coastal regions.

## Why This Program?

Somalia faces critical challenges in fisheries:

- Limited scientific capacity for stock assessment
- Inconsistent data collection across regions
- Weak policy-science linkages
- Unsustainable fishing practices
- Food security concerns

This program directly addresses these gaps through practical, science-based training.
