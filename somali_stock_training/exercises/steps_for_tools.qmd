# Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the necessary software for our training session on length-based stock assessment. We will install:

1.  **R**: The programming language for statistical computing.
2.  **RStudio**: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working with R much easier.
3.  **R Packages**: Specific add-ons for R that we will use for data manipulation, plotting, and the LBSPR analysis.

Please follow these steps *before* the training session begins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 1: Install R

R is the core programming language we will be using. You must install R before you can install RStudio.

1.  Go to the **Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)** website: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

2.  Click on the download link for your operating system:

    -   **Download R for Windows**
    -   **Download R for macOS**
    -   **Download R for Linux**

3.  Select the **"base"** distribution (or the latest recommended version for your OS).

4.  Run the downloaded installer file and follow the on-screen instructions. It is safe to accept all the default settings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2: Install an IDE (Choose One)

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) makes writing and running code much easier. For this training, we recommend RStudio, but advanced users may prefer Positron. You only need to install **one** of them.

### Option A: RStudio Desktop (Recommended)

RStudio is the classic, widely-used IDE for R.

1.  Go to the Posit website to download RStudio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

2.  The website should automatically detect your operating system. Click the **"DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP"** button for the free version.

3.  Run the downloaded installer file and follow the on-screen instructions. The default settings are fine.

### Option B: Positron (Alternative for VS Code Users)

Positron is a modern IDE from the creators of RStudio that runs as an extension inside Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

1.  **Install VS Code**: If you don't already have it, download and install Visual Studio Code from <https://code.visualstudio.com/>.

2.  **Install the Positron Extension**:

    -   Open VS Code.
    -   Click on the Extensions icon in the activity bar on the left (it looks like four squares).
    -   Search for `Positron - R IDE` in the marketplace search bar.
    -   Find the extension published by **Posit** and click **Install**. This will also automatically install the required "R" extension.

> After installation, you can open R files and use the R console directly within VS Code, similar to how you would in RStudio.

#### First Steps in Positron (for Beginners)

If you are new to VS Code and Positron, here is a quick guide to get you started:

1.  **Open Your Project Folder**:
    -   In VS Code, go to `File > Open Folder...` and select the main folder for this training (e.g., `somali_stock_training`). This will show all your files in the **Explorer** panel on the left.
2.  **Find the R Console**:
    -   Once you open an R script (a file ending in `.R` or `.qmd`), Positron's R tools will become active.
    -   You can open the R console by going to the main menu `View > Terminal` and ensuring the "R" tab is selected in the bottom panel. You can also use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for `R: Create R Terminal`.
3.  **Arrange Your Workspace**:
    -   The VS Code interface is flexible. A common layout is:
        -   **Editor** (top-center) for your R scripts.
        -   **R Console** (bottom-center) to see command output.
        -   **Positron Panes** (left or right sidebars) for Environment, Plots, Help, and Packages. You can open these from the "R" icon in the activity bar on the far left.
4.  **Run R Code**:
    -   Open an R script (e.g., a `.qmd` file from the `presentations` folder).
    -   Place your cursor on a line of R code inside a code chunk.
    -   Press **`Ctrl+Enter`** (on Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd+Enter`** (on macOS) to run that single line. The code will execute in the R console.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 3: Install Required R Packages

Packages are collections of functions and data that extend R's capabilities. We will install them from within your chosen IDE (RStudio or Positron/VS Code).

1.  Open the **RStudio** or **VS Code** application.

2.  Find the panel labeled **"Console"**. This is where you can type commands directly to R.

3.  Copy the following command, paste it into the console, and press **Enter**.

``` r
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "LBSPR", "readxl", "janitor", "tidyplots"))
```

4.  R will now download and install these packages from the internet. This may take a few minutes. You might see a lot of text printed in the console, which is normal. If you are asked `Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?`, it is usually safe to type `No` and press Enter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 4: Verify Your Installation

Let's make sure everything is working correctly.

1.  In the R console within your IDE, type the following commands one by one, pressing **Enter** after each one.

``` r
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)
library(LBSPR)
```

2.  If the commands run without any `Error:` messages (warnings are okay), then your installation was successful! You are now ready for the training session.

If you encounter any problems during this setup, please don't hesitate to ask for help.
