# Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing the necessary software for our training session on length-based stock assessment. We will install:

1. **R**: The programming language for statistical computing and data analysis.
2. **RStudio or Positron**: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working with R much easier and more user-friendly.
3. **R Packages**: Specialized add-ons for R that provide pre-built functions for data manipulation, visualization, and stock assessment analysis.

**Why do we need all three?** R is the engine, the IDE is the driver's seat that makes it comfortable to use, and packages are specialized tools that solve specific problems.

Please follow these steps **before** the training session begins. The entire setup typically takes 30-60 minutes depending on your internet speed.

## Step 1: Install R

**What is R?** R is a free, open-source programming language specifically designed for statistical computing and data analysis. It's the foundation that everything else depends on.

**Why install it first?** RStudio and Positron are interfaces to R—they won't work without R installed on your computer.

**Installation steps:**

1. Go to the **Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)** website: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

2. Look for the large download button and click on the link for your operating system:
   - **Download R for Windows** (if you use Windows)
   - **Download R for macOS** (if you use Mac)
   - **Download R for Linux** (if you use Linux)

3. Select the **"base"** distribution (this is the standard R package—other options are for advanced users).

4. Run the downloaded installer file:
   - **Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` file
   - **macOS:** Double-click the `.pkg` file
   - **Linux:** Follow the terminal instructions

5. Follow the on-screen prompts. **You can safely accept all default settings**—there's no need to customize anything.

6. Once installation completes, you're done with this step. You don't need to open R yet.

## Step 2: Install an IDE (Choose One)

**What is an IDE?** An Integrated Development Environment is a user-friendly application that lets you write, run, and debug R code much more easily than using R directly. Think of it like the difference between writing in a basic text editor versus Microsoft Word.

**Choose one option below:**

### Option A: RStudio Desktop (Recommended for Beginners)

RStudio is the most popular IDE for R. It has a clean, intuitive interface and is widely used in education and research.

**Installation steps:**

1. Go to the Posit website: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

2. The website will automatically detect your operating system. Click the blue **"DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP"** button to get the free version.

3. Run the downloaded installer file:
   - **Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` file
   - **macOS:** Double-click the `.dmg` file
   - **Linux:** Follow the terminal instructions

4. Follow the on-screen prompts. Default settings are fine.

5. Once installation completes, you can open RStudio from your applications menu.

**First launch:** When you open RStudio for the first time, you'll see four panels:
- **Script Editor** (top-left): Where you write code
- **Console** (bottom-left): Where code runs and shows results
- **Environment/History** (top-right): Shows variables and previous commands
- **Files/Plots/Packages/Help** (bottom-right): File browser and output displays

### Option B: Positron (Alternative for Advanced Users or VS Code Users)

Positron is a modern, lightweight alternative developed by Posit (the company behind RStudio). It runs inside Visual Studio Code and is ideal if you're familiar with code editors.

**When to choose Positron:**
- You already use Visual Studio Code for other programming
- You prefer a minimalist, modern interface
- You want a flexible, customizable development environment

**Installation steps:**

1. **Install VS Code** (if you don't already have it):
   - Download from <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
   - Run the installer and follow defaults

2. **Install Positron extension**:
   - Open VS Code
   - Click the **Extensions icon** on the left sidebar (four squares)
   - Search for `Positron - R IDE`
   - Click the result published by **Posit** and click **Install**
   - This will also automatically install the R extension

3. Once installation completes, restart VS Code. Positron is now ready to use.

#### Getting Started with Positron (Quick Guide)

**If you're new to VS Code and Positron:**

1. **Open Your Project Folder**:
   - Go to `File > Open Folder...`
   - Select the main training folder (e.g., `somali_stock_training`)
   - The left sidebar **Explorer** will show all your files

2. **Open the R Console**:
   - Open any R file (files ending in `.R` or `.qmd`)
   - Go to `View > Terminal` or press **Ctrl+`** (backtick)
   - Select the **R** tab in the bottom panel
   - You should see an `>` prompt ready for commands

3. **Arrange Your Workspace** (Optional):
   - **Editor** (top-center): Where you write code
   - **R Console** (bottom-center): Where code runs
   - **Positron Sidebar** (left): Click the **R icon** to access Environment, Plots, Packages, Help
   - Drag panels to rearrange as you prefer

4. **Run R Code**:
   - Click in a line of R code inside a code chunk
   - Press **Ctrl+Enter** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Enter** (macOS)
   - The code executes in the R console below

## Step 3: Install Required R Packages

**What are packages?** Packages are collections of pre-written functions that solve specific problems. Our training uses specialized packages for fisheries analysis, data visualization, and stock assessment.

**The packages we need:**
- **tidyverse**: Data manipulation and visualization (essential for almost all analyses)
- **LBSPR**: Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio calculations
- **TropFishR**: Tropical fisheries stock assessment methods
- **sizeMat**: Estimating size at maturity
- **readxl**: Reading Excel files
- **janitor**: Data cleaning helpers
- **tidyplots**: Easy, professional plotting
- **gt**: Creating beautiful tables

**Installation steps:**

1. Open your IDE (**RStudio** or **VS Code with Positron**).

2. Find the **Console panel**—this is where you type commands directly to R.

3. Copy the entire command below, paste it into the console, and press **Enter**:

```r
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-summary: "Install required packages"

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "LBSPR", "readxl", "janitor", "tidyplots", "sizeMat", "TropFishR"))
```

4. **What happens next:**
   - R will download the packages from the internet (this takes 5-15 minutes depending on speed)
   - You'll see lots of text in the console—this is normal
   - R may ask: `Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?`
     - Type `No` and press Enter (safer and faster)
   - When done, you'll see the `>` prompt again

5. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you get errors about missing dependencies, it's usually safe to run the command again
   - If a package fails, you can install it individually: `install.packages("PackageName")`
   - Internet connection issues? Try again or contact us for help

## Step 4: Verify Your Installation

**What we're doing:** Testing that everything works correctly before training starts.

**Verification steps:**

1. In the R console, type the following commands **one at a time**, pressing **Enter** after each:

```r
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-summary: "Verify package installation"

library(tidyverse)
library(LBSPR)
```

2. **Expected result:**
   - If you see text that looks like "Loading required package: ..." without any red error messages, your installation is successful!
   - **Warnings** (yellow text) are okay—they're informational only
   - **Errors** (red text starting with "Error:") mean something is wrong

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If you get an error, note the exact text and share it with us
   - Common issue: You may need to restart R (go to `Session > Restart R`)
   - Still having problems? Check your internet connection and try the package installation again
