## Data Collection Considerations

### Key Variables to Monitor at Landing Sites

1. **Catch Data**: Species, quantities, sizes
2. **Effort Data**: Number of vessels, fishing trips, gear types
3. **Biological Data**: Length-frequency, weight, maturity, age
4. **Economic Data**: Prices, market trends, value chains
5. **Environmental Data**: Sea conditions, temperature, seasonal patterns

### Best Practices for Landing Site Monitoring

1. **Consistency**: Regular sampling schedules
2. **Standardization**: Uniform measurement protocols across sites
3. **Training**: Well-trained enumerators at each location
4. **Quality Control**: Data validation and verification procedures
5. **Community Engagement**: Collaboration with local fishers and traders

## Regional Priorities

### Immediate Priority Sites (High Activity)
- Berbera Port
- Bosaso Port
- Mogadishu landing sites (Lido, Panama Beach)
- Kismayo Port

### Secondary Sites (Developing Capacity)
- Zeila
- Merca
- Barawe
- Other smaller landing sites

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (2024-2025): Establish Core Sites
- Deploy trained enumerators at priority sites
- Standardize data collection protocols
- Set up data management systems

### Phase 2 (2025-2026): Expand Coverage
- Add secondary sites
- Strengthen regional coordination
- Implement quality control measures

### Phase 3 (2026-2027): Full Network Operation
- Complete coastal coverage
- Real-time data sharing
- Integration with management systems

## Data Integration

Landing site data from these locations should be:
- Entered into the Project Kalluun database
- Quality-checked for consistency
- Analyzed for temporal and spatial trends
- Shared with regional and national fisheries authorities
- Used for stock assessment and management advice
