# Understanding Fish Stocks {background-color="#447099"}

## What is a Fish Stock? {.scrollable}

Understanding the basic unit of assessment is critical to interpreting model results correctly.

</div>

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Principle
Model outputs apply only to the defined stock. Proper stock identification is essential for meaningful assessment results.
:::

---

## Critical Assumptions {.scrollable}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### 1. Stock Boundaries

**Scientific Basis:** The assessed population represents a self-sustaining unit with minimal immigration or emigration.

**Practical Implication:** Fish movement between regions must be negligible relative to population size.

### 2. Fishing as Primary Driver

**Scientific Basis:** Population dynamics are driven by natural mortality and fishing mortality, not by migration patterns.

**Practical Implication:** Changes in stock size reflect fishing pressure, not population shifts.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### 3. Representative Sampling

**Scientific Basis:** Length distributions in catches accurately represent the population structure.

**Practical Implication:** Sampling must be unbiased and cover the full spatial and temporal range of the fishery.

::: {.callout-tip}
## For This Training
We will assess **yellowfin tuna** caught in Somali waters as a discrete stock, recognizing this is a simplification that may require refinement for formal assessments.

# Length-Based Assessment Methods {background-color="#447099"}

## Why Use Length-Based Models? {.scrollable}

### The Challenge of Data-Limited Fisheries

Many developing-nation fisheries lack:
- Age-reading laboratories and trained personnel
- Long-term catch and effort time series
- Comprehensive biological sampling programs
- Resources for expensive aging techniques (otolith reading)

### The Solution: Length-Based Analysis

**Advantages:**
- Length data is relatively easy and inexpensive to collect
- Measurements can be taken dockside without specialized equipment
- Large sample sizes are feasible with minimal resources
- Well-established theoretical foundation

::: {.callout-important}
## Core Assumption
The length distribution in your **catch sample** must reflect the length distribution in the **exploited population**. Biased sampling (e.g., only large fish, one gear type) will compromise results.
:::

---

## The LBSPR Model Framework {.scrollable}

### What is LBSPR?

**Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio** is a stock assessment model that estimates reproductive capacity under current fishing pressure.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Scientific Foundation

- Developed by Hordyk et al. (2015)
- Based on equilibrium life history theory
- Uses size-structured population dynamics
- Validated across multiple species and fisheries

### Model Outputs

**Primary Metric: SPR (Spawning Potential Ratio)**
- Proportion of unfished reproductive potential remaining
- Values range from 0 (collapsed) to 1 (unfished)
- Directly comparable to management reference points
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Interpreting SPR Values

| SPR Range | Stock Status | Management Implication |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|
| > 0.40 | Healthy | Current fishing sustainable |
| 0.20 - 0.40 | Moderately exploited | Monitor closely, consider precautionary measures |
| < 0.20 | Overfished | Urgent management action required |

::: {.callout-note}
## Reference Points
- **Target:** SPR = 40% (widely used globally)
- **Limit:** SPR = 20% (conservation threshold)
- These values may be adjusted based on species-specific characteristics and management objectives
:::
:::
::::

---

# Model Parameters {background-color="#447099"}

## Required Inputs Overview {.scrollable}

LBSPR requires two types of information:

1. **Observed Data:** Length frequency measurements from catch samples
2. **Life History Parameters:** Species-specific biological characteristics

::: {.callout-tip}
## Data Sources
Life history parameters can often be obtained from:
- [FishBase](https://www.fishbase.se/) - comprehensive global database
- Published literature for your region
- Studies on closely related species (if species-specific data unavailable)
:::

---

## Biological Parameters {.scrollable}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Growth Parameters

**Linf (Asymptotic Length)**
- Maximum theoretical length the species can attain
- Units: cm or mm (must be consistent)
- Represents the average size of very old fish

**M/K Ratio**
- M = Natural mortality rate
- K = von Bertalanffy growth coefficient
- Ratio provides information on life history strategy
- Higher M/K = faster growth, higher natural mortality

### Maturity Parameters

**L50 (Length at 50% Maturity)**
- Length at which 50% of fish are sexually mature
- Critical for determining reproductive potential

**L95 (Length at 95% Maturity)**
- Length at which 95% of fish are mature
- Defines the maturity ogive shape
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Example Code: Yellowfin Tuna

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Create parameter object
MyPars <- new("LB_pars")

# Set biological parameters
MyPars@Linf <- 175    # cm, from FishBase
MyPars@L50 <- 100     # cm, maturity onset
MyPars@L95 <- 110     # cm, full maturity
MyPars@MK <- 1.5      # M/K ratio
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Parameter Uncertainty
Biological parameters carry uncertainty. When available, use locally-derived values rather than global averages. Document your parameter sources for transparency.
:::
:::
::::

---

## Selectivity Parameters {.scrollable}

Selectivity describes which fish sizes are vulnerable to your fishing gear.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Concept Explanation

**Selectivity Curve:** Describes the probability that a fish of a given length will be caught if encountered by fishing gear.

**SL50 (Length at 50% Selectivity)**
- Length at which 50% of encountered fish are retained
- Primarily determined by gear characteristics (mesh size, hook size)

**SL95 (Length at 95% Selectivity)**
- Length at which essentially all fish are fully vulnerable
- Defines the steepness of the selectivity curve

### Practical Implications

- Gear modifications can change selectivity
- Minimum size regulations affect selectivity
- Multiple gear types require careful consideration
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Implementation

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Selectivity parameters
MyPars@SL50 <- 60     # cm, gear selectivity onset
MyPars@SL95 <- 75     # cm, full selectivity

# Optional: Set target SPR
MyPars@SPR <- 0.4     # 40% target
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Estimating Selectivity
If you don't have external estimates:
- Start with SL50 ≈ 0.5 × L50 (maturity)
- The model can estimate these parameters
- Compare model estimates with gear characteristics for validation
:::
:::
::::

---

## Size Class Specification {.scrollable}

Define how length data is organized for analysis.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Parameters

**BinWidth**
- Width of each length class (cm or mm)
- Balance: Too narrow = sparse data; Too wide = loss of information
- Recommendation: 2-5 cm for most species

**BinMin and BinMax**
- Define the range of your analysis
- Should encompass the full observed range
- Extend slightly beyond smallest/largest observations

**L_units**
- Specify measurement units (cm or mm)
- Must match all other length parameters
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Code Implementation

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Size class parameters
MyPars@BinWidth <- 5   # 5 cm bins
MyPars@BinMax <- 180   # Maximum size class
MyPars@BinMin <- 20    # Minimum size class
MyPars@L_units <- "cm" # Unit specification
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Best Practices
- Review your length frequency histogram before setting bins
- Ensure adequate sample sizes in each bin
- Document any fish excluded due to unusual sizes
:::
:::
::::

# Practical Application {background-color="#447099"}

## Workflow Overview {.scrollable}

The analysis follows a systematic five-step process:

```{mermaid}
graph TD
    A[Step 1: Prepare Length Data] --> B[Step 2: Create Parameter Object]
    B --> C[Step 3: Populate Parameters]
    C --> D[Step 4: Fit Model]
    D --> E[Step 5: Interpret Results]

    style D fill:#fff4e1
    style E fill:#e8f5e9
```

## Step 1: Data Preparation {.scrollable}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Data Quality Checks

Before analysis, ensure your data meets these criteria:

**✓ Completeness**
- No missing length measurements
- Adequate sample size (minimum 200 fish recommended)
- Samples span fishing season

**✓ Representativeness**
- Random or systematic sampling
- Coverage across fishing grounds
- Multiple gear types if applicable

**✓ Accuracy**
- Consistent measurement protocol
- Regular calibration of equipment
- Quality control procedures
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Data Processing Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Filter and extract length data
tuna_lengths <- lw |> 
  filter(
    fish_group == "Tuna",
    !is.na(length_cm),
    length_cm > 0  # Remove invalid entries
  ) |> 
  pull(length_cm)

# Sample size verification
n_samples <- length(tuna_lengths)
cat("Sample size:", n_samples, "\n")

# Summary statistics
summary(tuna_lengths)
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Minimum Sample Size
While 200+ fish is ideal, the model can run with fewer samples. However, results will have wider confidence intervals. Always report your sample size alongside results.
:::
:::
::::

---

## Step 1: Visual Inspection {.scrollable}

Always visualize your data before modeling to identify potential issues.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### What to Look For

**Normal Distribution Indicators:**
- Single mode (peak) in distribution
- Smooth, bell-shaped curve
- Reasonable spread

**Warning Signs:**
- Multiple distinct peaks (mixed stocks?)
- Extreme outliers
- Heavy truncation (size-selective sampling?)
- Gaps in size ranges
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Visualization Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Create histogram
hist(tuna_lengths, 
     breaks = 30,
     main = "Yellowfin Tuna Length Distribution",
     xlab = "Fork Length (cm)",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     col = "lightblue",
     border = "darkblue")

# Add summary lines
abline(v = mean(tuna_lengths), 
       col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
abline(v = median(tuna_lengths), 
       col = "green", lwd = 2, lty = 2)

legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Mean", "Median"),
       col = c("red", "green"),
       lty = 2, lwd = 2)
```

## Steps 2-3: Model Setup {.scrollable}

### Complete Parameter Specification

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Initialize parameter object
MyPars <- new("LB_pars")

# === Biological Parameters ===
# Source: FishBase + Regional studies
MyPars@Linf <- 175    # Asymptotic length (cm)
MyPars@L50 <- 100     # Length at 50% maturity (cm)
MyPars@L95 <- 110     # Length at 95% maturity (cm)
MyPars@MK <- 1.5      # Natural mortality / Growth rate

# === Selectivity Parameters ===
# Based on gear characteristics
MyPars@SL50 <- 60     # Length at 50% selectivity (cm)
MyPars@SL95 <- 75     # Length at 95% selectivity (cm)

# === Size Classes ===
MyPars@BinWidth <- 5  # 5 cm bins
MyPars@BinMax <- 180  # Upper limit
MyPars@BinMin <- 20   # Lower limit
MyPars@L_units <- "cm"

# === Management Target (Optional) ===
MyPars@SPR <- 0.4     # 40% SPR target
```

::: {.callout-note}
## Parameter Documentation
Maintain a separate document detailing the source and rationale for each parameter. This is essential for peer review and management presentations.
:::

---

## Step 4: Model Fitting {.scrollable}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Running the Analysis

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Fit LBSPR model to length data
lbspr_fit <- LBSPRfit(
  MyPars,               # Parameters
  tuna_lengths,         # Length data
  Control = list(       # Optional controls
    modtype = "GTG"     # Growth-type-group model
  )
)

# View estimated parameters
lbspr_fit@Ests
```

### Model Fitting Process

The model performs maximum likelihood estimation to find parameter values that best explain your observed length distribution.

**Estimated Parameters:**
- F/M ratio (fishing/natural mortality)
- SPR (spawning potential ratio)
- Selectivity curves (if not fixed)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Diagnostic Checks

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Check model convergence
if (lbspr_fit@SPR < 0 | lbspr_fit@SPR > 1) {
  warning("SPR estimate outside valid range")
}

# Examine fit quality
# Compare observed vs predicted length frequencies
plotSize(lbspr_fit)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Troubleshooting
If the model fails to converge or produces unrealistic estimates:
- Verify parameter values (especially M/K)
- Check for adequate sample size
- Ensure length data quality
- Consider if equilibrium assumption is valid
:::
:::

## Step 5: Results Visualization {.scrollable}

### Comprehensive Output Plot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| fig-width: 10
#| fig-height: 6

# Generate main results plot
plotSim(lbspr_fit)
```

### Interpreting the Multi-Panel Output

**Left Panel: Length Frequency Fit**
- Grey bars: Your observed data
- Red line: Model prediction
- Good fit = line follows bar pattern closely
- Poor fit may indicate model assumptions violated

**Right Panel: Stock Status Indicators**
- Black point: Estimated SPR value
- Grey shading: Uncertainty (95% confidence interval)
- Horizontal lines: Reference points (if specified)

---

## Interpreting Stock Status {.scrollable}

### SPR-Based Assessment Framework

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Scientific Interpretation

**SPR = 0.45 (Example)**

This means the current fished stock retains 45% of the reproductive capacity it would have in an unfished state.

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Compare to established reference points
- Consider confidence interval width
- Evaluate model fit quality

### Management Translation

**For Policymakers:**
"The stock is currently at a healthy level, above the 40% sustainability target, suggesting current fishing practices are within acceptable limits."
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### F/M Ratio Interpretation

**F/M = 0.8 (Example)**

Fishing mortality is 80% of natural mortality.

| F/M Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 1.0 | Fishing pressure below natural mortality |
| ≈ 1.0 | Moderate exploitation |
| > 1.5 | High fishing pressure, sustainability concerns |

::: {.callout-important}
## Decision Context
Always interpret results within the context of:
- Historical trends (if available)
- Economic dependencies
- Management capacity
- Ecosystem considerations

# Best Practices & Limitations {background-color="#447099"}

## Model Assumptions & Validity {.scrollable}

### Critical Assumptions

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**1. Equilibrium**
- Stock is in equilibrium (stable size/age structure)
- Fishing pressure has been relatively constant
- Recruitment hasn't changed dramatically

**2. Selectivity**
- Selectivity pattern is dome-shaped or asymptotic
- No cryptic mortality (e.g., ghost fishing)
- Size-based selectivity (not age-based)

**3. Growth**
- von Bertalanffy growth is appropriate
- Parameters apply to your stock
- No significant growth changes over time
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**4. Life History**
- M/K ratio is correct for your species
- Maturity schedules are accurate
- No significant plasticity in life history traits

**5. Sampling**
- Catch samples represent population structure
- No bias toward certain sizes
- Adequate sample sizes across size ranges

::: {.callout-warning}
## When LBSPR May Not Apply
- Highly variable recruitment
- Recent major fishing pattern changes
- Significant migration during sampling
- Strong environmental drivers of growth
:::
:::
::::

---

## Uncertainty & Sensitivity Analysis {.scrollable}

### Sources of Uncertainty

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Parameter Uncertainty**
- Life history parameters from literature
- Variable growth across regions
- Maturity schedules may shift

**Sampling Uncertainty**
- Limited sample sizes
- Temporal/spatial coverage gaps
- Gear selectivity variations

**Model Uncertainty**
- Equilibrium assumption
- Simplified population dynamics
- Single-stock assumption
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Addressing Uncertainty

**1. Sensitivity Analysis**
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Test different M/K values
MK_values <- c(1.2, 1.5, 1.8)
results <- list()

for (i in seq_along(MK_values)) {
  MyPars@MK <- MK_values[i]
  results[[i]] <- LBSPRfit(MyPars, tuna_lengths)
}

# Compare SPR estimates
sapply(results, function(x) x@SPR)
```

**2. Confidence Intervals**
- Always report with uncertainty bounds
- Wider intervals = more caution needed

**3. Multiple Lines of Evidence**
- Complement with other assessments
- Consider ecological indicators
- Validate with fishery-dependent data

## Reporting Results {.scrollable}

### For Scientific Audiences

**Essential Elements:**
1. **Methods:** Model version, parameter sources, data collection protocol
2. **Results:** Point estimates with confidence intervals, model diagnostics
3. **Discussion:** Assumption validity, sensitivity analysis, limitations
4. **Conclusions:** Stock status relative to reference points

### For Management Audiences

**Key Messages Framework:**

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example: Stock Status Report

**Current Status:** The yellowfin tuna stock in Somali waters shows an estimated SPR of 42% (95% CI: 35-49%), indicating the stock retains approximately 42% of its unfished reproductive capacity.

**Management Implication:** This places the stock slightly above the international sustainability target of 40%, suggesting current fishing levels are near maximum sustainable levels.

**Recommendation:** Maintain current fishing pressure while implementing enhanced monitoring. Any increases in effort should trigger precautionary management measures.

**Uncertainty:** Parameter estimates carry moderate uncertainty. We recommend annual reassessment to track trends and verify assumptions.

### The Value of Length-Based Assessment

**For Data-Limited Contexts:**
LBSPR and similar length-based methods represent a practical middle ground between no assessment and data-intensive age-structured models. While not perfect, they provide quantitative evidence for management decisions where alternatives are limited.

**For Evidence-Based Management:**
Regular application of these methods can:
- Track stock trends over time
- Trigger management responses
- Evaluate regulation effectiveness
- Support adaptive management cycles

**For Sustainable Fisheries:**
Ultimately, the goal is not perfect assessment but improved decision-making. Even approximate stock status information is vastly better than none, provided we understand and communicate limitations.
