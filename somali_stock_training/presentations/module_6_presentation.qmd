  "Scale: [TEST WITH 1KG WEIGHT] - Result: ___kg\n",
  "Ruler: [MEASURE REFERENCE OBJECT] - Result: ___cm\n",
  file = "field_log.txt"
)
```

---

## Site Preparation

### Arrival Procedures:

**Checklist:**

::: {.callout-note}
- [ ] Meet site manager/fisher representative
- [ ] Identify landing area & vessel schedule
- [ ] Set up measurement station (protected from weather)
- [ ] Position scale on flat, stable surface
- [ ] Organize forms and materials
- [ ] Brief fishers on sampling procedure
- [ ] Take site photos
- [ ] Note weather conditions
- [ ] Confirm contact information
:::

---

## Fish Measurement Protocol

### Standard Procedure:

**Step 1: Species Identification**
```
Before measuring, identify fish correctly

- Use ID guide provided
- Consult fisher if uncertain
- Record common name AND scientific name
- Note any unusual features
```

**Step 2: Length Measurement**
```
- Use fork length (snout to middle tail fin)
- Place fish on measuring board
- Read to nearest 0.1 cm
- Record immediately on form
```

---

## Fish Measurement (continued)

### Step 3: Weight Measurement

```
- Use tared scale (zeroed before weighing)
- Place fish in weighing pan
- Wait for reading to stabilize
- Read to nearest 0.1 kg
- Record immediately
```

### Step 4: Additional Data

```
- Sex (if identifiable): M/F/Unknown
- Maturity stage: 1-5 scale
- Condition: Normal/Injured/Diseased
- Special observations: Notes field
```

---

## Field Data Form Example

### Standardized Format:

```
DAILY LANDING RECORD
Site: _____________ Date: _________ Observer: _________
Weather: __________ Vessel ID: _______ Effort (hours): ___

| Species | Length(cm) | Weight(kg) | Sex | Maturity | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----|----------|-------|
| Tuna    | 45.2      | 12.5      | M   | 3        | Good  |
| Mackerel| 32.1      | 8.3       | F   | 4        | Damaged|
| ...     |           |           |     |          |       |

Total Fish Measured: ___ 
Total Landings Observed: ___
Sampling Rate: ____%
```

---

## Quality Control in Field

### Real-Time Checks:

```r
# Create QC checking function
field_qc_check <- function(species, length_cm, weight_kg) {
  
  issues <- character(0)
  
  # Length checks
  if (length_cm < 5) issues <- c(issues, "Length too small")
  if (length_cm > 200) issues <- c(issues, "Length too large")
  
  # Weight checks
  if (weight_kg < 0.1) issues <- c(issues, "Weight too light")
  if (weight_kg > 500) issues <- c(issues, "Weight too heavy")
  
  # Plausibility check
  expected_max_weight <- 0.01 * (length_cm ^ 3)
  if (weight_kg > expected_max_weight * 2) {
    issues <- c(issues, "Weight implausible for length")
  }
  
  return(issues)
}

# Use in field
if (length(field_qc_check("Tuna", 45, 12.5)) > 0) {
  print("⚠ FLAG THIS RECORD FOR REVIEW")
}
```

---

## Duplicate Prevention

### In-Field Checks:

```r
# Keep running list of measured fish
measured_fish <- tibble(
  species = character(),
  length_cm = numeric(),
  time = POSIXct()
)

# Before recording, check if already measured
check_duplicate <- function(new_species, new_length) {
  recent <- measured_fish |>
    filter(
      species == new_species,
      abs(length_cm - new_length) < 0.5,
      time > Sys.time() - minutes(5)
    )
  
  if (nrow(recent) > 0) {
    print("⚠ POSSIBLE DUPLICATE - ASK FISHER")
  }
}
```

---

## Working with Fishing Communities

### Building Trust & Partnership:

::: {.incremental}
- **Explain the purpose** clearly in local language
- **Show respect** for fisher knowledge
- **Ask permission** before photographing
- **Offer small compensation** where appropriate
- **Share preliminary results** with community
- **Thank fishers** for cooperation
- **Return with findings** later
- **Listen to concerns** about management
:::

---

## Communication in Field

### Key Phrases (Somali):

```
English          →  Somali
Good morning     →  Subax wanaagsan
Thank you        →  Mahadsanid
What is this fish? → Kalluun yahan waxaa?
How many vessels? → Doonni yiman?
What time landing? → Saacada yahan?
Can I measure?   →  Miyaan tiri karaa?
```

### Always:
- Speak clearly and slowly
- Use hand gestures
- Have local assistant help
- Repeat important information

---

## Daily Data Recording

### End-of-Day Procedures:

**Before Leaving Site:**
1. Count total records collected
2. Verify all forms complete
3. Check for missing species ID
4. Review flags & corrections
5. Take photos of forms
6. Back up data to cloud
7. Thank site staff
8. Confirm next visit date

---

## Evening Data Entry

### Process at Accommodation:

```r
# file: evening_data_entry.R

# Import paper form data
daily_data <- tibble(
  landing_date = Sys.Date(),
  species = c("Tuna", "Mackerel", "Shark"),
  length_cm = c(45.2, 32.1, 48.5),
  weight_kg = c(12.5, 8.3, 14.2)
)

# Run QC checks from Module 5
source('scripts/field_qc.R')
daily_data_clean <- validate_landing_data(daily_data)

# Create daily summary
summary_stats <- daily_data_clean |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_L = mean(length_cm),
    mean_W = mean(weight_kg)
  )

# Save to backup location
write.csv(daily_data_clean, 
  paste0('backups/daily_', Sys.Date(), '.csv'))
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Field Problems

### Problem: Scale Not Working

**Solutions:**
- Check batteries (carry spares)
- Verify scale is on flat surface
- Clean sensor with dry cloth
- Use backup scale if available
- Fall back to weight estimates
- Recalibrate after power restored

### Problem: Can't Identify Fish

**Solutions:**
- Ask the fisher (they're experts!)
- Take clear photo for later ID
- Compare with ID guide carefully
- Group as "Unknown" if unsure
- Mark for follow-up verification

---

## Troubleshooting (continued)

### Problem: Fishers Uncooperative

**Solutions:**
- Explain benefits of monitoring
- Offer monetary compensation
- Involve community leaders
- Choose different time of day
- Work with local assistant
- Emphasize sustainable fisheries

### Problem: Too Many Fish to Sample

**Solutions:**
- Sample systematically (every nth fish)
- Increase team size
- Sample during slower period
- Pre-arrange larger monitoring team
- Document sampling rate clearly
- Scale up numbers using sampling fraction
