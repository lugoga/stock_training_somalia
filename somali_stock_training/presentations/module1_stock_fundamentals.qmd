## MODULE I {.center}

### Fundamentals and Concepts

---

## Key Guiding Questions

::: {.incremental}
- What is sustainable fisheries management?
- What is fish stock assessment, and why is it crucial?
- Why is fish stock assessment important in sustainable fisheries?
- Which fisheries to focus on for stock assessment?
- How do assessment results inform policy, regulations, and conservation?
- What are key requirements, challenges, and limitations?
:::

---

## Key Guiding Questions (cont.)

::: {.incremental}
- Understanding inherent uncertainties in assessing wild fish populations
- **Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management (EBFM)**: Managing beyond single species catch data
- Integrating ecological, social, and economic considerations
- Linking stock assessment to ecosystem management
:::

---

## What is Fish Stock Assessment?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
A fishery stock assessment is the **scientific process** of:

- Collecting data
- Analyzing information
- Reporting on fish stock condition
- Estimating sustainable yield
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

{{< placeholder >}}

**Stock assessments are the backbone of sustainable fisheries management**
:::
::::

## Data Sources for Stock Assessment

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### (1) Fishery-Dependent Data

Information collected from:

- Fishermen
- Dealers
- Catch records
- Landings data
- Effort metrics
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
{{< placeholder >}}

::::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
{{< placeholder >}}
:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
### (2) Fishery-Independent Data

Information collected by scientists via:

- Long-term research surveys
- Scientific studies
- Direct observation
:::
::::


---

## Why Assess Fish Stocks?

::: {.incremental}
1. **Determine Status**: Evaluate current population conditions

2. **Evaluate Management Actions**: Assess potential impacts of regulations

3. **Forecast Future Conditions**: Predict stock trajectory

4. **Define Benchmarks**: Establish desirable conditions using abundance or biomass references
:::

---

## Concepts: Life History

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Age & Growth**

- Rate of approaching maximum size

**Feeding**

- Trophic levels and strategies

**Reproduction**

- Fecundity
- Reproductive peaks
- Life cycle patterns
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Habitat**

- Habitat loss impacts
- Water quality effects
- Critical for management plans

**Natural Mortality (M)**

- Critical parameter
- Incorporated in population dynamics models
:::
::::

---

## Concepts: Population Dynamics

**Recruitment**

- Number of fish surviving to juvenile stage within a given time period

**Growth**

- How fish size and weight change over time

**Mortality**

- Number of fish dying within a given time period

---

## Types of Mortality

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="33%"}
**Natural Mortality (M)**

Deaths from natural causes
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Fishing Mortality (F)**

Deaths from fishing activity
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Total Mortality (Z)**

Z = M + F

Sum of natural and fishing mortality
:::
::::

---

## Concepts: Reference Points

### Two Main Categories

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Biological Reference Points**

Based on biological characteristics of the stock
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Exploitation Reference Points**

Based on fishing pressure and harvest levels
:::
::::

---

## Exploitation: Yield Per Recruit

**Understanding fishing pressure effects on cohort catch**

::: {.incremental}
- Analyzes the catch obtained from a single cohort over its lifetime
- Helps determine optimal fishing mortality rate
- Considers growth, natural mortality, and fishing mortality
- Key tool for evaluating fishing strategies
:::

## Stock-Recruitment Relationship

**How spawning stock size influences future recruitment**

::: {.incremental}
- Links parent population to offspring survival
- Critical for understanding population resilience
- Helps predict future stock abundance
- Informs spawning stock biomass targets
:::

<br>

{{< placeholder >}}

---

## Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY)

> The theoretical maximum catch that can be taken from a fish stock indefinitely without impairing its ability to replenish

::: {.incremental}
- Primary management target for many fisheries
- Balances harvest and stock productivity
- Requires careful monitoring and adjustment
- May not account for ecosystem effects
:::

## Overfishing: Growth Overfishing

**Catching fish before they reach optimal size**

::: {.fragment}
### Consequences:

- Reduced total yield
- Lost growth potential
- Economic inefficiency
- Smaller average fish size
:::

---

## Overfishing: Recruitment Overfishing

**Reducing spawning stock below sustainable levels**

::: {.fragment}
### Consequences:

- Insufficient recruits to sustain population
- Population decline
- Potential stock collapse
- Long recovery times
:::

---

## Summary

::: {.incremental}
- Stock assessment combines fishery-dependent and independent data
- Population dynamics driven by recruitment, growth, and mortality
- Reference points guide management decisions
- Understanding life history is essential
- Overfishing threatens sustainability
- Ecosystem-based approaches integrate broader considerations
