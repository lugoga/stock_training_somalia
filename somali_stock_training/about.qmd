### Why TAFIRI Leads This Training

TAFIRI's leadership in this initiative is grounded in:

| Dimension | Strength |
|-----------|----------|
| **Regional Expertise** | Decades of experience conducting stock assessments in Indian Ocean fisheries |
| **Scientific Excellence** | Recognized experts in length-based methods, surplus production models, and data-limited approaches |
| **Research Infrastructure** | Modern facilities, comprehensive databases, and professional networks across East Africa |
| **Practical Experience** | Direct engagement with data-poor fisheries and context-specific assessment solutions |
| **Capacity Development** | Institutional commitment to training future fisheries scientists and managers |

## Course Development Philosophy

This program draws on TAFIRI's extensive research portfolio and reflects:

- **Real-world relevance**: Case studies from East African and Indian Ocean fisheries
- **Proven methods**: Assessment approaches tested in similar data-limited contexts
- **International standards**: Alignment with FAO Technical Guidelines and best practices
- **Regional solutions**: Practical approaches to challenges specific to Somali and regional fisheries

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this training, participants will:

- ✓ Conduct stock assessments using limited and available data
- ✓ Interpret assessment results and communicate findings to decision-makers
- ✓ Support evidence-based fisheries management at regional and national levels
- ✓ Apply international assessment standards in East African contexts
