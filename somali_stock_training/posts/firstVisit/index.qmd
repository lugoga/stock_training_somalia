## A Warm Welcome

The first day was filled with warm welcomes, introductions, and an orientation session to familiarize the participants with the TAFIRI facilities and the overall training schedule. There is a palpable sense of excitement and eagerness among the delegates to begin the collaborative work of strengthening fishery management capacities in their home country.

The team at TAFIRI and the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology are honored to host our colleagues and facilitate this important initiative.

## What's Next?

In the coming days, we will dive into the foundational modules of stock assessment, data collection methodologies, and analytical tools. The program is designed to be hands-on and highly interactive.

We extend our warmest welcome to our Somali colleagues and look forward to a productive and collaborative training period. Stay tuned for more updates as we progress through the program!
