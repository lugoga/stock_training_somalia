## Overview

Statistical analysis transforms raw data into insights for stock assessment and management. This module introduces practical analytical approaches.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will:

- [ ] Apply descriptive statistics to fisheries data
- [ ] Conduct time series analysis
- [ ] Calculate stock indicators
- [ ] Create effective visualizations
- [ ] Interpret results and communicate findings

## Descriptive Statistics

### Summary Metrics
- Mean, median, standard deviation
- Distribution of catch
- Size composition trends
- Species diversity indices

### By-Group Analysis
- Temporal trends (yearly, seasonal)
- Spatial patterns (by region, site)
- Gear comparisons
- Species dynamics

## Time Series Analysis

### Methods
- Trend analysis (increasing/decreasing?)
- Seasonality (predictable patterns?)
- Anomaly detection (unusual events?)
- Forecasting (what's next?)

### Applications
- Catch trends over years
- Seasonal landing patterns
- Fleet dynamics
- Early warning signals

## Stock Indicators

### Key Indicators
- **Mean Length:** Population structure indicator
- **Length at Maturity:** Recruitment to fishing
- **Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE):** Abundance proxy
- **Composition Changes:** Exploitation signals

### Calculation & Interpretation
- Data requirements
- Calculation procedures
- Confidence intervals
- Threshold values

## Visualization Techniques

### Essential Charts
- Time series plots (trends)
- Bar charts (comparisons)
- Box plots (distributions)
- Scatter plots (relationships)
- Maps (spatial patterns)

### Best Practices
- Clear titles and labels
- Appropriate scales
- Color-blind friendly palettes
- Publication-ready quality

## Statistical Testing

### Hypothesis Testing
- Is there a significant trend?
- Are regions significantly different?
- Is CPUE declining?
- Which factor matters most?

### Methods
- T-tests, ANOVA
- Regression analysis
- Non-parametric tests
- Model comparison

## Introduction to R

### Why R?
- Free and open-source
- Powerful statistical capabilities
- Publication-quality graphics
- Reproducible analysis

### Basic Workflow
```r
# Load data
data <- read.csv("landings.csv")

# Summarize
summary(data)

# Visualize
plot(data$year, data$catch)

# Analyze
model <- lm(catch ~ year, data = data)
```

## Practical Activities

- [ ] Calculate descriptive statistics from sample data
- [ ] Create time series visualizations
- [ ] Calculate stock indicators
- [ ] Write brief analysis report

## Resources

- **R Scripts:** Analysis templates and examples
- **Data:** Sample Somali fisheries datasets
- **Guides:** R tutorials and documentation
- **References:** Recommended statistics texts

## Assessment

- Statistical calculation exercises
- Data visualization project
- Brief written interpretation
- R code review
