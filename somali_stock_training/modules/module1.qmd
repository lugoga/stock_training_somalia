## Content Areas

### 1. Stock Assessment Fundamentals

**Definition:** Stock assessment is the process of evaluating the status of a fish population using available data and scientific methods to inform management decisions.

**Key questions it answers:**

- How many fish are in the stock?
- Are we fishing sustainably?
- What catch level can we maintain indefinitely?
- Is the stock recovering or declining?

- Definition and objectives
- Why stock assessment matters for management
- Assessment approaches (data-rich vs. data-limited)
- Success factors in assessment

### 2. Key Biological Parameters

Understanding these parameters is essential because they determine how a population responds to fishing:

```{mermaid}
graph TB
    subgraph Biology["<b>BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS</b>"]
        G["<b>GROWTH (K, Linf)</b><br/>How fast fish grow<br/>to maximum size"]
        M["<b>MORTALITY (M, Z, F)</b><br/>Death rates from<br/>natural causes & fishing"]
        R["<b>RECRUITMENT</b><br/>New young fish<br/>entering the population"]
        Mat["<b>MATURITY (L50, L95)</b><br/>Size/age when fish<br/>can reproduce"]
    end
    
    Output["<b>Population<br/>Productivity</b><br/>How much we can<br/>harvest sustainably"]
    
    G --> Output
    M --> Output
    R --> Output
    Mat --> Output
    
    style G fill:#bbdefb
    style M fill:#ffccbc
    style R fill:#c8e6c9
    style Mat fill:#f8bbd0
    style Output fill:#fff9c4
```

**Details for each parameter:**

- **Growth:** von Bertalanffy growth curves, length-weight relationships
- **Mortality:** Natural mortality, fishing mortality, total mortality
- **Recruitment:** Recruitment variations, stock-recruitment relationships
- **Maturity:** Age/size at maturity, fecundity (egg production)

### 3. Population Dynamics

How fish populations change over time in response to fishing:

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    subgraph Unfished["<b>UNFISHED STOCK</b>"]
        direction TB
        U1["Large older fish<br/>Many juveniles<br/>High biomass"]
    end
    
    subgraph Moderate["<b>MODERATELY FISHED</b>"]
        direction TB
        M1["Mix of sizes<br/>Fewer old fish<br/>Medium biomass"]
    end
    
    subgraph Overfished["<b>OVERFISHED</b>"]
        direction TB
        O1["Mostly juveniles<br/>Few large fish<br/>Low biomass<br/>Low reproduction"]
    end
    
    Unfished -->|Increasing<br/>Fishing| Moderate
    Moderate -->|Excessive<br/>Fishing| Overfished
    Overfished -->|Fishing<br/>Reduction| Moderate
    
    style Unfished fill:#c8e6c9
    style Moderate fill:#fff9c4
    style Overfished fill:#ffccbc
```

- Population models and how they work
- Surplus production models (simple, data-limited approach)
- Age-structured population models (complex, data-rich approach)
- Equilibrium versus dynamic concepts

### 4. Data Requirements

**Different assessment methods need different data:**

```{mermaid}
graph TB
    subgraph DataRich["<b>DATA-RICH ASSESSMENT</b><br/>(Integrated Models)"]
        DR["✓ Age data from otoliths<br/>✓ Detailed catch history<br/>✓ Survey indices<br/>✓ Biological samples<br/>✓ Effort data"]
    end
    
    subgraph DataModerate["<b>DATA-MODERATE</b><br/>(Length-Based Methods)"]
        DM["✓ Length-frequency data<br/>✓ Catch history<br/>✓ Growth parameters<br/>✓ Maturity ogives"]
    end
    
    subgraph DataLimited["<b>DATA-LIMITED</b><br/>(Empirical Indicators)"]
        DL["✓ Catch data<br/>✓ Basic biology<br/>✓ Expert knowledge<br/>✓ Effort trends"]
    end
    
    Accuracy["Assessment<br/>Accuracy<br/>& Detail"]
    
    DataRich --> Accuracy
    DataModerate --> Accuracy
    DataLimited --> Accuracy
    
    style DataRich fill:#bbdefb
    style DataModerate fill:#fff9c4
    style DataLimited fill:#ffccbc
```

- What data is needed for different approaches?
- Data quality considerations and QA/QC
- Data limitations in the Indian Ocean
- Working with incomplete data (practical reality)

### 5. Assessment Approaches

Choosing the right method depends on available data and resources:

```{mermaid}
graph TB
    Start{"What data<br/>do you have?"}
    
    Age["Age Data<br/>from Otoliths<br/>or Scales"]
    Length["Length<br/>Frequency<br/>Data"]
    Catch["Only Catch<br/>& Effort<br/>Data"]
    
    Integrated["<b>Integrated Assessment</b><br/>Age-Structured Models<br/>Very Detailed<br/>Most Accurate"]
    LBSPR["<b>Length-Based</b><br/>LBSPR | LIME<br/>Moderate Detail<br/>Practical & Robust"]
    CatchMSY["<b>Empirical Methods</b><br/>Catch-MSY | Simple Indicators<br/>Limited Detail<br/>Quick & Useful"]
    
    Start -->|Yes| Age --> Integrated
    Start -->|Yes| Length --> LBSPR
    Start -->|Limited| Catch --> CatchMSY
    
    style Start fill:#e1f5fe
    style Age fill:#bbdefb
    style Length fill:#fff9c4
    style Catch fill:#ffccbc
    style Integrated fill:#c8e6c9
    style LBSPR fill:#c8e6c9
    style CatchMSY fill:#c8e6c9
```

- Catch-MSY methods (simplest, data-limited)
- Length-based approaches (our focus in this training)
- Simple empirical indicators (quick assessment)
- Integrated stock assessment models (most complex)

## Key Concepts

:::{.callout-tip}
**Stock:** A group of individuals of one species, occupying a defined area and showing independent population dynamics. A stock is the management unit.
:::

:::{.callout-note}
**Assessment:** The process of evaluating the status of a stock using available data and scientific methods to answer: "Is this stock healthy? Can we increase catches? Do we need to reduce fishing?"
:::

:::{.callout-warning}
**Sustainability Principle:** The fundamental goal of stock assessment is to ensure fish populations remain productive indefinitely—balancing the needs of people today with fish stocks for the future.
:::

## Practical Activities

- [ ] Review case studies from Indian Ocean fisheries
- [ ] Identify data needs for Somali fisheries
- [ ] Discuss assessment priorities by region
- [ ] Map your own country's data availability
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks and solutions

## Assessment

- Class participation
- Case study group discussion
- Short quiz on biological parameters
- Concept mapping exercise (relating parameters to population outcomes)
