title: "Module 2: Fisheries Data Types"
---

## Overview

Fisheries stock assessment relies on diverse data types. This module explores what data is available, how it's collected, and how it's used.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will:

- [ ] Classify different fisheries data types
- [ ] Understand advantages and limitations of each data type
- [ ] Explain how different data types serve assessment needs
- [ ] Recognize data quality indicators
- [ ] Assess data availability for Somali stocks

## Data Types Covered

### 1. Catch Data
- Landings by species
- Temporal trends
- Spatial information
- Data sources and quality

### 2. Effort Data
- Fishing effort metrics
- Fleet characteristics
- Seasonality
- Regional variations

### 3. Catch Composition Data
- Species composition
- Size composition
- Discard data
- Bycatch information

### 4. Biological Sampling Data
- Length measurements
- Age data
- Maturity observations
- Condition factors

### 5. Environmental Data
- Sea surface temperature
- Oceanographic conditions
- Seasonal patterns
- Climate impacts

## Somali Fisheries Context

### Typical Data Available
- Landing site monitoring (partial)
- Market surveys (limited)
- Observer programs (developing)
- Research surveys (sparse)

### Gaps and Challenges
- Limited historical data
- Spatial and temporal gaps
- Quality inconsistencies
- Limited biological sampling

## Data Quality Framework

```
Data Quality Assessment:
├── Completeness (% of data collected)
├── Accuracy (measurement error)
├── Consistency (within and across regions)
├── Timeliness (how current is the data)
└── Validity (plausibility of values)
```

## Practical Activities

- [ ] Review actual Somali landing site data
- [ ] Identify data gaps for your region
- [ ] Assess data quality issues
- [ ] Propose data improvements

## Resources

- **Reference Data:** Example datasets from IOTC
- **Standards:** FAO Guidelines on Data Collection
- **Tools:** Excel templates for data entry

## Assessment

- Data type identification quiz
- Quality assessment exercise
- Group discussion on Somali data needs
