title: "Module 6: Practical Field Exercises at Landing Sites"
---

## Overview

Hands-on training at operational landing sites brings modules 1-5 into practice. This day-long exercise demonstrates real-world fisheries monitoring.

## Training Locations

Field exercises will be conducted at three key landing sites:

- **Casco Port** - Active fishing port with diverse species
- **China Port** - Major landing and processing facility
- **Panama Port** - Coastal landing site with daily operations

Each site provides unique learning opportunities and exposure to different operational contexts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will:

- [ ] Execute landing site monitoring protocols
- [ ] Collect and record fisheries data
- [ ] Identify species in operational settings
- [ ] Solve real-world monitoring challenges
- [ ] Coordinate multi-site activities

## Morning Activities (08:00-12:30)

### Setup and Brief
- Venue introduction
- Equipment check
- Safety briefing
- Role assignments

### Live Data Collection
- Monitor actual landings
- Take measurements
- Record catch composition
- Collect biological samples

### Hands-On Learning
- Practice species identification
- Learn measurement techniques
- Observe data entry
- Ask real-time questions

## Afternoon Activities (13:30-16:45)

### Data Review
- Check data quality
- Identify errors
- Discuss solutions
- Practice corrections

### Analysis Exercise
- Summarize collected data
- Calculate indicators
- Create visualizations
- Interpret results

### Regional Coordination
- Meet colleagues from other sites
- Share experiences
- Discuss local challenges
- Coordinate best practices

## Troubleshooting Exercise

### Common Field Challenges

**Challenge 1:** Species Identification
- Solution: Use identification guide
- Reference: Trained species expert
- Practice: Unknown specimens brought by fishers

**Challenge 2:** Missing Data
- Solution: Reconstruction from vessel records
- Backup: Recall from fisher interviews
- Documentation: Record what's missing and why

**Challenge 3:** Uncooperative Vessels
- Solution: Explain value of monitoring
- Alternative: Sample from market
- Relationships: Build trust over time

**Challenge 4:** Equipment Issues
- Solution: Backup scales, rulers
- Planning: Preventive maintenance
- Contingency: Manual measurements

## Regional Coordination Meeting

### Topics Covered
- Landing site challenges specific to region
- Coordination between sites
- Training follow-up plans
- Resource needs
- Implementation timeline

### Outcomes
- Regional protocols agreed
- Coordinator roles clarified
- Support mechanisms established
- Next steps planned

## Practical Activities

- [ ] Collect at least 50 fish measurements
- [ ] Record 20+ catch composition records
- [ ] Identify 15+ species
- [ ] Complete one full data entry form

## Safety Considerations

- Footwear (slip-resistant, water-proof)
- Clothing (appropriate for weather)
- Hand protection (when handling fish)
- Sun protection (hat, sunscreen)
- First aid knowledge

## Resources

- **Guide:** Field monitoring manual
- **Forms:** Waterproof data sheets
- **Tools:** Measurement boards, digital scales
- **Reference:** Laminated species identification chart

## Assessment

- Practical measurement accuracy
- Species identification test
- Data recording quality
- Problem-solving discussion
- Participation and engagement

## Reflections

Participants should consider:
- What worked well at this landing site?
- What challenges did you encounter?
- How will you apply this training?
- What support do you need for implementation?
