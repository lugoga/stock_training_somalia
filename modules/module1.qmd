title: "Module 1: Fundamentals of Fish Stock Assessment"
---

## Overview

This foundational module introduces core concepts in fisheries stock assessment, establishing the scientific basis for all subsequent training.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will:

- [ ] Understand the purpose and scope of stock assessment
- [ ] Explain key biological parameters (growth, mortality, recruitment)
- [ ] Describe population dynamics fundamentals
- [ ] Identify appropriate data types for different assessment scenarios
- [ ] Apply best practices in fisheries science

## Content Areas

### 1. Stock Assessment Fundamentals
- Definition and objectives
- Why stock assessment matters for management
- Assessment approaches (data-rich vs. data-limited)
- Success factors in assessment

### 2. Key Biological Parameters
- **Growth:** von Bertalanffy growth curves, length-weight relationships
- **Mortality:** Natural mortality, fishing mortality
- **Recruitment:** Recruitment variations, stock-recruitment relationships
- **Maturity:** Age/size at maturity, fecundity

### 3. Population Dynamics
- Population models
- Surplus production models
- Age-structured population models
- Equilibrium versus dynamic concepts

### 4. Data Requirements
- What data is needed?
- Data quality considerations
- Data limitations in the Indian Ocean
- Working with incomplete data

### 5. Assessment Approaches
- Catch-MSY methods
- Length-based approaches
- Simple empirical indicators
- Integrated stock assessment models

## Key Concepts
