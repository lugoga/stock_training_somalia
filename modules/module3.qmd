title: "Module 3: Data Collection Methods"
---

## Overview

Standardized, high-quality data collection is essential for effective stock assessment. This module covers practical protocols for monitoring fisheries.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will:

- [ ] Design sampling schemes for landing sites
- [ ] Implement quality assurance procedures
- [ ] Train data collectors
- [ ] Handle common field challenges
- [ ] Coordinate regional monitoring

## Sampling Design Principles

### Key Concepts
- **Population:** Target of inference (all landings in a region)
- **Sampling:** Efficient way to estimate population characteristics
- **Stratification:** Dividing population into meaningful groups
- **Random selection:** Reducing bias in sampling

### Sampling Types
- Systematic sampling (every nth landing)
- Stratified sampling (by vessel type, season, species)
- Purposive sampling (typical vessels)
- Adaptive sampling (responsive to conditions)

## Landing Site Monitoring

### Standard Protocol
1. **Pre-landing observation** - vessel and crew info
2. **Catch landing** - species and weight recording
3. **Length sampling** - take random sample for measurement
4. **Biological sampling** - collect specimens for analysis
5. **Data recording** - digital or paper forms

### Quality Assurance Checks
- Duplicate measurements
- Data validation rules
- Supervisor verification
- Regular audits

## Observer Programs

### Onboard Observation
- Vessel selection
- Observer training
- Data collection at sea
- Safety protocols

### Challenges

- Issue resolution

## Practical Activities

- [ ] Practice species identification with specimens
- [ ] Complete data entry exercises
- [ ] Role-play landing site scenarios
- [ ] Develop regional protocols

## Resources

- **Forms:** Standardized data collection templates
- **Guide:** Landing site monitoring manual
- **Tools:** Measurement boards, scales, specimen jars

## Assessment
